I am Pushpak Das, a Senior Research Fellow and PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Meghalaya, focusing on energy-efficient computing for sustainable smart cities. My work integrates AI, edge computing, and green ICT to build low-power algorithms for intelligent urban infrastructure; recent efforts span AI-driven resource orchestration, V2X communication frameworks, and vehicular-edge networks.

Across roles in industry and academia I have shipped Salesforce and REST integrations, taught Java, networks, and security, and led simulations and cloud projects funded by national research boards. At Nokia (Jan-Jul 2024) I advanced energy-efficient V2X communication systems, and at NIT Meghalaya I contributed to PMU data analytics for smart grids and vehicular network simulations using SUMO, OMNeT++, and VEINS.

I am currently pursuing research on intelligent and sustainable computing, mentoring students, and exploring AI for traffic management, energy optimization, and human-centered computing. I enjoy building with Python, MATLAB, AWS ML tools, and Apex/JavaScript for applied machine learning, and I stay curious about information security, Linux, Docker, and the evolving Internet of Things. An upcoming publication on hybrid approaches for deadline-sensitive tasks in fog computing reflects this applied research focus.
