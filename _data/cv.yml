  summary: Born along the Indo-Nepal border in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, I grew up in a rural environment where access to advanced infrastructure was limited which sparked a deep curiosity about how intelligent and energy-efficient computing systems could transform communities. This curiosity guided me towards engineering and research, where early exposure to communication networks and distributed systems shaped my long-term pursuit of sustainable and intelligent computing technologies.
